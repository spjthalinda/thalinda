It solves the same kind of problems as a parser generator, just **without any code generation**. Chevrotain Grammars are pure code which can be created/debugged/edited\nas any other pure code without requiring any new tools or processes.\n\n## TLDR\n\n-   [**Online Playground**](https://sap.github.io/chevrotain/playground/)\n-   **[Getting Started Tutorial](https://sap.github.io/chevrotain/docs/tutorial/step0_introduction.html)**\n-   [**Performance benchmark**][benchmark]\n\n## Installation\n\n-   **npm**: `npm install chevrotain`\n-   **Browser**:\n    The npm package contains Chevrotain as concatenated and minified files ready for use in a browser.\n    These can also be accessed directly via [UNPKG](https://unpkg.com/) in a script tag.\n    -   Latest:\n        -   `https://unpkg.com/chevrotain/lib/chevrotain.js`\n        -   `https://unpkg.com/chevrotain/lib/chevrotain.min.js`\n    -   Explicit version number:\n        -   `https://unpkg.com/chevrotain@4.1.1/lib/chevrotain.js`\n        -   `https://unpkg.com/chevrotain@4.1.1/lib/chevrotain.min.js`\n\n## Documentation & Resources\n\n-   **[Getting Started Tutorial](https://sap.github.io/chevrotain/docs/tutorial/step1_lexing.html)**.\n\n-   **[Sample Grammars](https://github.com/SAP/chevrotain/blob/master/examples/grammars)**.\n\n-   **[FAQ](https://sap.github.io/chevrotain/docs/FAQ.html).**\n\n-   **[Other Examples](https://github.com/SAP/chevrotain/blob/master/examples)**.\n\n-   **[HTML API docs](https://sap.github.io/chevrotain/documentation).**\n\n    -   [The Parsing DSL Docs](https://sap.github.io/chevrotain/documentation/4_1_1/classes/parser.html#at_least_one).\n\n## Dependencies\n\nThere is a single dependency to [regexp-to-ast](https://github.com/bd82/regexp-to-ast) library.\nThis dependency is included in the bundled artifacts, for ease of consumption in browsers.\n\n## Compatibility\n\nChevrotain runs on any modern JavaScript ES5.1 runtime.\nThat includes any modern nodejs version, modern browsers and even IE11.\n\n-   Uses [UMD](https://github.com/umdjs/umd) to work with common module loaders (browser global / amd / commonjs).\n\n## Contributions\n\nContributions are **greatly** appreciated.\nSee [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for details.\n\n## Where used\n\nSome interesting samples:\n\n-   [JHipster Domain Language][sample_jhipster]\n-   [Metabase BI expression parser][sample_metabase].\n-   [Eve Programing Language][sample_eve].\n-   [BioModelAnalyzer's ChatBot parser][sample_biomodel].\n-   [Bombadil Toml Parser][sample_bombadil]\n-   [BrightScript Parser][sample_bright]\n\n[benchmark]: https://sap.github.io/chevrotain/performance/\n[sample_metabase]: https://github.com/metabase/metabase/blob/136dfb17954f4e4302b3bf2fee99ff7b7b12fd7c/frontend/src/metabase/lib/expressions/parser.js\n[sample_jhipster]: https://github.com/jhipster/jhipster-core/blob/master/lib/dsl/jdl_parser.js\n[sample_eve]: https://github.com/witheve/Eve/blob/master/src/parser/parser.ts\n[sample_biomodel]: https://github.com/Microsoft/BioModelAnalyzer/blob/master/ChatBot/src/NLParser/NLParser.ts\n[sample_bombadil]: https://github.com/sgarciac/bombadil/blob/master/src/parser.ts\n[sample_bright]: https://github.com/RokuRoad/bright/blob/master/src/Parser.ts\n[languages]: https://github.com/SAP/chevrotain/tree/master/examples/implementation_languages\n[backtracking]: https://github.com/SAP/chevrotain/blob/master/examples/parser/backtracking/backtracking.js\n[custom_apis]: https://sap.github.io/chevrotain/docs/guide/custom_apis.html\n",

Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.
