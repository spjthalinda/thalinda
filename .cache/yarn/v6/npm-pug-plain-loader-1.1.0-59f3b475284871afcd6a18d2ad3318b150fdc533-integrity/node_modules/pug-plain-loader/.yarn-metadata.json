    "readme": "# pug-plain-loader\n\nA loader that simply compiles pug templates into HTML.\n\n## Installation\n\nNote `pug` is a peer dependency, so make sure to install both:\n\n``` sh\nnpm install -D pug-plain-loader pug\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nThis loader is mostly intended to be used alongside `vue-loader` v15+, since it now requires using webpack loaders to handle template preprocessors. There's also [`pug-html-loader`](https://github.com/willyelm/pug-html-loader) which unfortunately is out-of-date and not actively maintained.\n\nIf you are only using this loader for templating in single-file Vue components, simply configure it with:\n\n``` js\n{\n  module: {\n    rules: [\n      {\n        test: /\\.pug$/,\n        loader: 'pug-plain-loader'\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis will apply this loader to all `<template lang=\"pug\">` blocks in your Vue components.\n\nIf you also intend to use it to import `.pug` files as HTML strings in JavaScript, you will need to chain `raw-loader` after this loader. Note however adding `raw-loader` would break the output for Vue components, so you need to have two rules, one of them excluding Vue components:\n\n``` js\n{\n  module: {\n    rules: [\n      {\n        test: /\\.pug$/,\n        oneOf: [\n          // this applies to pug imports inside JavaScript\n          {\n            exclude: /\\.vue$/,\n            use: ['raw-loader', 'pug-plain-loader']\n          },\n          // this applies to <template lang=\"pug\"> in Vue components\n          {\n            use: ['pug-plain-loader']\n          }\n        ]\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Options\n\nSee [Pug compiler options](https://pugjs.org/api/reference.html#options).\n\nThe `doctype` option is set to `html` by default, since most Vue templates are HTML fragments without explicit doctype.\n\nAn additional option `data` can be used to pass locals for the template, although this is typically not recommended when using in Vue components.\n",
