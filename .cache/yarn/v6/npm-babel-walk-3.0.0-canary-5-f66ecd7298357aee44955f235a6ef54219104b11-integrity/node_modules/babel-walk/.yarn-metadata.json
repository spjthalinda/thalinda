    "readme": "# babel-walk\n\nLightweight AST traversal tools for [Babel] ASTs.\n\n[Babel] supplies the wonderful [babel-traverse] module for walking Babel ASTs. Problem is, babel-traverse is very heavyweight, as it is designed to supply utilities to make all sorts of AST transformations possible. For simple AST walking without transformation, babel-traverse brings a lot of overhead.\n\nThis module loosely implements the API of Acorn parser's [walk module], which is a lightweight AST walker for the ESTree AST format.\n\nIn my tests, babel-walk's ancestor walker (the most complex walker provided by this module) is about 8 times faster than babel-traverse, if the visitors are cached and the same AST is used for all runs. It is about 16 times faster if a fresh AST is used every run.\n\n[![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/github/workflow/status/pugjs/babel-walk/Publish%20Canary/master?style=for-the-badge)](https://github.com/pugjs/babel-walk/actions?query=workflow%3A%22Publish+Canary%22)\n[![Rolling Versions](https://img.shields.io/badge/Rolling%20Versions-Enabled-brightgreen?style=for-the-badge)](https://rollingversions.com/pugjs/babel-walk)\n[![NPM version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/babel-walk?style=for-the-badge)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-walk)\n\n[babel]: https://babeljs.io/\n[babel-traverse]: https://github.com/thejameskyle/babel-handbook/blob/master/translations/en/plugin-handbook.md#toc-babel-traverse\n[walk module]: https://github.com/ternjs/acorn#distwalkjs\n\n## Installation\n\n```sh\n$ npm install babel-walk\n```\n\n## API\n\n```js\nvar walk = require('babel-walk');\n```\n\n### walk.simple(visitors)(node, state)\n\nDo a simple walk over the AST. `node` should be the AST node to walk, and `visitors` an object containing Babel [visitors]. Each visitor function will be called as `(node, state)`, where `node` is the AST node, and `state` is the same `state` passed to `walk.simple`.\n\nWhen `walk.simple` is called with a fresh set of visitors, it will first \"explode\" the visitors (e.g. expanding `Visitor(node, state) {}` to `Visitor() { enter(node, state) {} }`). This exploding process can take some time, so it is recommended to cache the result of calling `walk.simple(visitors)` and communicate state leveraging the `state` parameter.\n\nAll [babel-types] aliases (e.g. `Expression`) work, but the union syntax (e.g. `'Identifier|AssignmentPattern'(node, state) {}`) does not.\n\n### walk.ancestor(visitors)(node, state)\n\nDo a simple walk over the AST, but memoizing the ancestors of the node and making them available to the visitors. `node` should be the AST node to walk, and `visitors` an object containing Babel [visitors]. Each visitor function will be called as `(node, state, ancestors)`, where `node` is the AST node, `state` is the same `state` passed to `walk.ancestor`, and `ancestors` is an array of ancestors to the node (with the outermost node being `[0]` and the current node being `[ancestors.length - 1]`). If `state` is not specified in the call to `walk.ancestor`, the `state` parameter will be set to `ancestors`.\n\nWhen `walk.ancestor` is called with a fresh set of visitors, it will first \"explode\" the visitors (e.g. expanding `Visitor(node, state) {}` to `Visitor() { enter(node, state) {} }`). This exploding process can take some time, so it is recommended to cache the result of calling `walk.ancestor(visitors)` and communicate state leveraging the `state` parameter.\n\nAll [babel-types] aliases (e.g. `Expression`) work, but the union syntax (e.g. `'Identifier|AssignmentPattern'(node, state) {}`) does not.\n\n### walk.recursive(visitors)(node, state)\n\nDo a recursive walk over the AST, where the visitors are responsible for continuing the walk on the child nodes of their target node. `node` should be the AST node to walk, and `visitors` an object containing Babel [visitors]. Each visitor function will be called as `(node, state, c)`, where `node` is the AST node, `state` is the same `state` passed to `walk.recursive`, and `c` is a function that takes a single node as argument and continues walking _that_ node. If no visitor for a node is provided, the default walker algorithm will still be used.\n\nWhen `walk.recursive` is called with a fresh set of visitors, it will first \"explode\" the visitors (e.g. expanding `Visitor(node, state) {}` to `Visitor() { enter(node, state) {} }`). This exploding process can take some time, so it is recommended to cache the result of calling `walk.recursive(visitors)` and communicate state leveraging the `state` parameter.\n\nUnlike other babel-walk walkers, `walk.recursive` does not call the `exit` visitor, only the `enter` (the default) visitor, of a specific node type.\n\nAll [babel-types] aliases (e.g. `Expression`) work, but the union syntax (e.g. `'Identifier|AssignmentPattern'(node, state) {}`) does not.\n\nIn the following example, we are trying to count the number of functions in the outermost scope. This means, that we can simply walk all the statements and increment a counter if it is a function declaration or expression, and then stop walking. Note that we do not specify a visitor for the `Program` node, and the default algorithm for walking `Program` nodes is used (which is what we want). Also of note is how I bring the `visitors` object outside of `countFunctions` so that the object can be cached to improve performance.\n\n```js\nimport * as t from 'babel-types';\nimport {parse} from 'babel';\nimport * as walk from 'babel-walk';\n\nconst visitors = walk.recursive({\n  Statement(node, state, c) {\n    if (t.isVariableDeclaration(node)) {\n      for (let declarator of node.declarations) {\n        // Continue walking the declarator\n        c(declarator);\n      }\n    } else if (t.isFunctionDeclaration(node)) {\n      state.counter++;\n    }\n  },\n\n  VariableDeclarator(node, state) {\n    if (t.isFunction(node.init)) {\n      state.counter++;\n    }\n  },\n});\n\nfunction countFunctions(node) {\n  const state = {\n    counter: 0,\n  };\n  visitors(node, state);\n  return state.counter;\n}\n\nconst ast = parse(`\n  // Counts\n  var a = () => {};\n\n  // Counts\n  function b() {\n    // Doesn't count\n    function c() {\n    }\n  }\n\n  // Counts\n  const c = function d() {};\n`);\n\ncountFunctions(ast);\n// = 3\n```\n\n[babel-types]: https://github.com/babel/babel/tree/master/packages/babel-types\n[cache your visitors]: https://github.com/thejameskyle/babel-handbook/blob/master/translations/en/plugin-handbook.md#toc-optimizing-nested-visitors\n[visitors]: https://github.com/thejameskyle/babel-handbook/blob/master/translations/en/plugin-handbook.md#toc-visitors\n\n## Caveat\n\nFor those of you migrating from Acorn to Babel, there are a few things to be aware of.\n\n1. The visitor caching suggestions do not apply to Acorn's walk module, but do for babel-walk.\n\n2. babel-walk does not provide any of the other functions Acorn's walk module provides (e.g. `make`, `findNode*`).\n\n3. babel-walk does not use a `base` variable. The walker algorithm is the same as what babel-traverse uses.\n   - That means certain nodes that are not walked by Acorn, such as the `property` property of a non-computed `MemberExpression`, are walked by babel-walk.\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n",
